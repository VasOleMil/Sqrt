# Sqrt
Square root, stable and fast algorithm

Given Sqrt algorithm is very stable, but for large numbers and their ultimate precision, its work consumes more resources, processor time. Working with a floating-point number system, you can get its maximum performance.

Logarithmic complex dependency also shows maximum possible efficiency in calculations of square root in such iterations methods.
